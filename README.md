A high performance, brokered messaging queue

It is a high performance,  brokered messaging queue which supports transient (1M msg/sec with microseconds latency)  and durable (~300K msg/sec with milliseconds latency) queues. Durable queues are similar to <B>Kafka</B>  where data are written to the file and consumers consume from the file.

It is mostly header only project with main.cpp as an example for broker, producer and consumer.

NOTE: This is an initial version and may not be ready for production use.



##Protocol: 

### Create a Topic: 

(Admin userid and password must be passed to create a topic. Also we need to define userid/password per topic which consumer/produder need to pass for authentication)
 

     Send a request  to the broker
    {
     "admin_password": "T0p$3cr31",
     "admin_user_id": "myq_admin",
     "broker_type": "queue",
     "cmd": "create_topic",
     "password": "T0p$3cr31",
     "topic": "test",
     "user_id": "test_admin"
    }


    Response: 
    {
       "cmd": "create_topic",
       "description": "topic created successfully",
       "status": "ok"
    }
    

###Join Topic (Consumer):
(Need to pass userid/password for topic 'test')

    Request:
    {
       "cmd": "join",
       "connection_type": "zmq",
       "password": "T0p$3cr31",
       "topic": "test",
       "type": "pull",
       "user_id": "test_admin"
    }
    Response: 
    {
       "bind_uri": "tcp://127.0.0.1:5002",
       "cmd": "join",
       "status": "ok",
       "topic": "test"
    }
 
### Join Topic (Producer): 
(Need to pass userid/password for topic 'test')

    Request:
    {
       "cmd": "join",
       "connection_type": "zmq",
       "password": "T0p$3cr31",
       "topic": "test",
       "type": "pub",
       "user_id": "test_admin"
     }
    Response:
    {
      "bind_uri": "tcp://127.0.0.1:5003",
      "cmd": "join",
      "status": "ok",
      "topic": "test"
    }
### Get the statistics about the topic

    Request:
    {
       "cmd": "stats",
       "password": "T0p$3cr31",
       "topic": "test",
       "user_id": "test_admin"
    }
    Response:
    {
      "cmd": "stats",
      "messages_received": 9499570,
      "messages_sent": 9491554,
      "publishers_count": 1,
      "queue_size": 8016,
      "status": "ok",
      "subscribers_count": 1,
      "total_bytes_read": 0,
      "total_bytes_written": 0
   }
